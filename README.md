# Covid Testing Site

A MERN stack application used for pooling - the combining specimens from several people and conducting a single NAAT laboratory test on the combined pool of specimens to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In this application, lab technicians can create pools and assign results to the pool after conducting the diagnostic and screening test on the pool. The application also provides a portal for users to login and see the results of their COVID tests.
